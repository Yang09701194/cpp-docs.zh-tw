# <a name="command-ids"></a>Command IDs
A command is fully described by its command ID alone (encoded in the **WM_COMMAND** message). This ID is assigned to the user-interface object that generates the command. Typically, IDs are named for the functionality of the user-interface object they are assigned to.  
  
 For example, a Clear All item in the Edit menu might be assigned an ID such as **ID_EDIT_CLEAR_ALL**. The class library predefines some IDs, particularly for commands that the framework handles itself, such as **ID_EDIT_CLEAR_ALL** or `ID_FILE_OPEN`. You will create other command IDs yourself.  
  
 When you create your own menus in the Visual C++ menu editor, it is a good idea to follow the class library's naming convention as illustrated by `ID_FILE_OPEN`. [Standard Commands](../mfc/standard-commands.md) explains the standard commands defined by the class library.
