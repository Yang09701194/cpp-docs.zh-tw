# <a name="frame-window-classes"></a>Frame-Window Classes
Each application has one "main frame window," a desktop window that usually has the application name in its caption. Each document usually has one "document frame window." A document frame window contains at least one view, which presents the document's data.  
  
## <a name="frame-windows-in-sdi-and-mdi-applications"></a>Frame Windows in SDI and MDI Applications  
 For an SDI application, there is one frame window derived from class [CFrameWnd](../mfc/reference/cframewnd-class.md). This window is both the main frame window and the document frame window. For an MDI application, the main frame window is derived from class [CMDIFrameWnd](../mfc/reference/cmdiframewnd-class.md), and the document frame windows, which are MDI child windows, are derived from class [CMDIChildWnd](../mfc/reference/cmdichildwnd-class.md).  
  
## <a name="use-the-frame-window-class-or-derive-from-it"></a>Use the Frame-Window Class, or Derive from It  
 These classes provide most of the frame-window functionality you need for your applications. Under normal circumstances, the default behavior and appearance they provide will suit your needs. If you need additional functionality, derive from these classes.
