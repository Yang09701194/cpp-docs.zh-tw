# <a name="cdaorelationfieldinfo-structure"></a>CDaoRelationFieldInfo Structure
The `CDaoRelationFieldInfo` structure contains information about a field in a relation defined for data access objects (DAO).  
  
## <a name="syntax"></a>Syntax  
  
```  
struct CDaoRelationFieldInfo  
{  
    CString m_strName;           // Primary  
    CString m_strForeignName;    // Primary  
};  
```  
  
#### <a name="parameters"></a>Parameters  
 `m_strName`  
 The name of the field in the primary table of the relation.  
  
 `m_strForeignName`  
 The name of the field in the foreign table of the relation.  
  
## <a name="remarks"></a>Remarks  
 A DAO relation object specifies the fields in a primary table and the fields in a foreign table that define the relation. The references to Primary in the structure definition above indicate how the information is returned in the `m_pFieldInfos` member of a [CDaoRelationInfo](../../mfc/reference/cdaorelationinfo-structure.md) object obtained by calling the [GetRelationInfo](../../mfc/reference/cdaodatabase-class.md#getrelationinfo) member function of class `CDaoDatabase`.  
  
 Relation objects and relation field objects are not represented by an MFC class. Instead, the DAO objects underlying MFC objects of class [CDaoDatabase](../../mfc/reference/cdaodatabase-class.md) contain a collection of relation objects, called the Relations collection. Each relation object, in turn, contains a collection of relation field objects. Each relation field object correlates a field in the primary table with a field in the foreign table. Taken together, the relation field objects define a group of fields in each table, which together define the relation. `CDaoDatabase` lets you access relation objects with a `CDaoRelationInfo` object by calling the `GetRelationInfo` member function. The `CDaoRelationInfo` object, then, has a data member, `m_pFieldInfos`, that points to an array of `CDaoRelationFieldInfo` objects.  
  
 Call the [GetRelationInfo](../../mfc/reference/cdaodatabase-class.md#getrelationinfo) member function of the containing `CDaoDatabase` object in whose Relations collection is stored the relation object you are interested in. Then access the `m_pFieldInfos` member of the [CDaoRelationInfo](../../mfc/reference/cdaorelationinfo-structure.md) object. `CDaoRelationFieldInfo` also defines a `Dump` member function in debug builds. You can use `Dump` to dump the contents of a `CDaoRelationFieldInfo` object.
