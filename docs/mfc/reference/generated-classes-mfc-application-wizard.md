# <a name="generated-classes-mfc-application-wizard"></a>Generated Classes, MFC Application Wizard
This topic lists the names of base classes and files that your project generates. By default, the names are based on the project name that you specified in the **New Project Dialog Box**. You can change most of these names, as described here:  
  
 **Generated classes**  
 The names of the classes created for the project. By default, the names are based on the project name. The default MFC project creates a C*ProjName*View class, a C*ProjName*App class, a C*ProjName*Doc class, a CMainFrame class, and a CChildFrame class. All other values on this page contain information about the class currently selected in the **Generated classes** list.  
  
 To change a class name, use the **Class Name** text box.  
  
 **Class name**  
 The name of the class that is currently selected in the **Generated classes** list. If the box is active, you can change the class name. When you change the focus from the **Class Name** box, any change to the selected class name appears in the **Generated classes** list.  
  
 **.h file**  
 The name of the header file of the class that is currently selected in the **Generated classes** list. If the text box is active, you can change the name of the header file.  
  
 **Base class**  
 The name of the base class of the currently selected class in the **Generated classes** list. If the box is active, you can select from the list another class for the base class.  
  
 **.cpp file**  
 The name of the source code file that is associated with the selected class. If the text box is active, you can change the name of the implementation file.
