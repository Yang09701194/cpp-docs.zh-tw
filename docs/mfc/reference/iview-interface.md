# <a name="iview-interface"></a>IView Interface
Implements several methods that [CWinFormsView](../../mfc/reference/cwinformsview-class.md) uses to send view notifications to a managed control.  
  
## <a name="syntax"></a>Syntax  
  
```  
interface class IView  
```  
  
## <a name="members"></a>Members  
  
### <a name="public-methods"></a>Public Methods  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[IView::OnActivateView](#onactivateview)|Called by MFC when a view is activated or deactivated.|  
|[IView::OnInitialUpdate](#oninitialupdate)|Called by the framework after the view is first attached to the document, but before the view is initially displayed.|  
|[IView::OnUpdate](#onupdate)|Called by MFC after the view's document has been modified; this function allows the view to update its display to reflect modifications.|  
  
## <a name="remarks"></a>Remarks  
 `IView` implements several methods that `CWinFormsView` uses to forward common view notifications to a hosted managed control. These are [OnInitialUpdate](#oninitialupdate), [OnUpdate](#onupdate) and [OnActivateView](#onactivateview).  
  
 `IView` is similar to [CView](../../mfc/reference/cview-class.md), but is used only with managed views and controls.  
  
 For more information on using Windows Forms, see [Using a Windows Form User Control in MFC](../../dotnet/using-a-windows-form-user-control-in-mfc.md).
