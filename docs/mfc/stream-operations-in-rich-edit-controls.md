# <a name="stream-operations-in-rich-edit-controls"></a>Stream Operations in Rich Edit Controls
You can use streams to transfer data into or out of a rich edit control ([CRichEditCtrl](../mfc/reference/cricheditctrl-class.md)). A stream is defined by an [EDITSTREAM](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb787891) structure, which specifies a buffer and an application-defined callback function.  
  
 To read data into a rich edit control (that is, stream the data in), use the [StreamIn](../mfc/reference/cricheditctrl-class.md#streamin) member function. The control repeatedly calls the application-defined callback function, which transfers a portion of the data into the buffer each time.  
  
 To save the contents of a rich edit control (that is, stream the data out), you can use the [StreamOut](../mfc/reference/cricheditctrl-class.md#streamout) member function. The control repeatedly writes to the buffer and then calls the application-defined callback function. For each call, the callback function saves the contents of the buffer.
