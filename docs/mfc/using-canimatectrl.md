# <a name="using-canimatectrl"></a>Using CAnimateCtrl
An animation control, represented by the class [CAnimateCtrl](../mfc/reference/canimatectrl-class.md), is a window that displays a clip in Audio Video Interleaved (AVI) format â€” the standard Windows video/audio format. An AVI clip is a series of bitmap frames, like a movie.  
  
 Since your thread continues executing while the AVI clip is displayed, one common use for an animation control is to indicate system activity during a lengthy operation. For example, the Windows Find dialog box displays a moving magnifying glass as the system searches for a file.  
  
 Animation controls can only play simple AVI clips, and they do not support sound. (For a complete list of limitations, see [CAnimateCtrl](../mfc/reference/canimatectrl-class.md).) Since the capabilities of an animation control are severely limited and subject to change, you should use an alternative such as the MCIWnd control if you need a control to provide multimedia playback and/or recording capabilities. For more information about the MCIWnd control, see the multimedia documentation.
